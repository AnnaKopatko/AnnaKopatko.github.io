### 1. The general rules
Specifically for pytorch-to-engine conversion there are some general rules that do now depend on the method of coversion that you chose:
- The model has to be single-device
- All data has to be pytorch tensors, so no numpy array 
- The functions used indise a model have to be pytorch functions(for example, no OpenCV functions)

### 2. The pytorch model-ONNX-TensorRT
