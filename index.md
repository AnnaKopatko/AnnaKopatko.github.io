# Anna Kopatko

## Perception Engineer | Deep Learning | Physics Enthusiast

I'm Anna Kopatko, a deep learning engineer based in Berlin, Germany.  
I hold a bachelor's degree in **Theoretical Physics**, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and understanding complex systems.

Currently, I work in the field of **perception engineering**, where I **research, implement, and deploy** a wide range of **neural network models**.  
My work spans across **object detection**, **segmentation**, **sensor fusion**, and other core perception tasks, helping intelligent systems better understand and navigate the world.

I am deeply passionate about combining **physics and neural networks** to create more robust, explainable, and efficient AI.  
I believe that merging physical principles with deep learning can **reshape the future of science, technology, and autonomous systems**.

Feel free to explore my projects, blog posts, and reach out if you're interested in collaboration!
