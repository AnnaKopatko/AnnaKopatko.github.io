<p>I am Anna Kopatko, a deep learning engineer based in Berlin, Germany. I hold a bachelor's degree in Theoretical Physics from Karazin National University in Kharkiv, where I was lucky enough to have my first job modeling the Yarkovsky effect using C++.</p>

<p>Since moving into deep learning, I've had the chance to work across different areas like sensor fusion, active learning, unsupervised learning, and many more. Along the way, I also developed a strong interest in how models are deployed â€” exploring different ways to bring AI systems into real-world applications, from straightforward setups to more optimized deployments.</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I'm passionate about boxing, martial arts, and crocheting.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore my projects, blog posts, and get in touch!</p>
